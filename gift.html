		<h2>Hey baby, nice job solving the puzzle!
		<br>
		<br>For your main birthday present I wanted to take you to the Haagse mineralenbeurs on April 5th...
		<br>The idea was that you could pick one or more nice stones to use in a piece of jewlerewlery that we would design together for you.		
	    <br>However, due to the current situation, the beurs is cancelled :(
	    <br>So I will take you to another mineralenbeurs when the world is healthy again!
	    <br>
	    <br>Love you!
	   	<br>
	   	<br>
	   	<br>Play some snake while you're in lockdown!
