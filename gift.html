		<h2>Hey baby, I wanted to take you to the Haagse mineralenbeurs on April 5th...
		<br>The idea was that you could pick one or more nice stones to use in a piece of jewlerewlery that we would design together for you.		
	    <br>However, due to the current situation, the beurs is cancelled :(
	    <br>So I will take you to another mineralenbeurs when the world is healthy again! Love you! </h2>
