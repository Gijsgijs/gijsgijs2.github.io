		<h2>Hey baby, I wanted to take you to the Haagse mineralenbeurs on April 5th, where you could pick one or more nice stones to use in a piece of jewlerewlery that we would design together for you.		However, due to the current situation, this is also cancelled, so I'll take you to another mineralenbeurs when the world is healthy again! Love you! </h2>
